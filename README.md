# 🛡️ Data Analysis of Cyber Security Attacks

## 📌 Problem Statement

In today’s hyper-connected digital age, cyber-attacks pose a significant threat to individuals, corporations, and governments alike. With the rapid increase in cyber threats ranging from malware and ransomware to phishing and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, understanding attack patterns and their impact has become a crucial challenge for cybersecurity professionals.

The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive data-driven analysis of cyber security attack incidents. By exploring, visualizing, and interpreting the data, the project aims to identify:

* The most common types of cyber attacks
* The industries and regions most targeted by attackers
* Trends in attack frequency over time
* Patterns and anomalies in attacker behavior

This analysis will help stakeholders make informed decisions, improve defense mechanisms, and reduce the risk of future breaches.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess the raw cybersecurity dataset.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights.
* Identify and visualize trends in cyber-attack types, sources, and targets.
* Assist in building awareness and preparedness strategies against future cyber threats.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains records of cybersecurity incidents, including details such as:

* **Attack Type**
* **Date/Time of Occurrence**
* **Industry Targeted**
* **Region/Country**
* **Source of Attack (e.g., IP origin)**
* **Severity or Impact**

## 🧠 Outcome

This project provides a foundation for understanding the landscape of cyber threats and enables organizations to:

* Strengthen their cyber defense based on trends and patterns.
* Allocate resources more effectively for threat mitigation.
* Inform policymaking and incident response strategies.
